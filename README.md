# AV-GS: Audio-Visual Gaussian Splatting for Novel-View Audio Synthesis

This repository contains the qualitative audio samples rendered from AV-GS, a novel approach for novel-view audio synthesis.

## Demo

Below are four examples demonstrating AV-GS's capability to synthesize audio for different locations in a house scene. Each example includes a visual representation of the scene from the listener's perspective and two audio files side by side: one from AV-NeRF and one from AV-GS.

### Example 1: Living Room

| AV-NeRF Audio | AV-GS Audio |
|---------------|-------------|
| <audio controls> <source src="assets/audio/avnerf_living_room_audio.wav" type="audio/wav"> Your browser does not support the audio element. </audio> | <audio controls> <source src="assets/audio/avgs_living_room_audio.wav" type="audio/wav"> Your browser does not support the audio element. </audio> |

In this example, you can hear the ambient sounds of the living room, including subtle background noise and perhaps the ticking of a clock.

### Example 2: Kitchen

| AV-NeRF Audio | AV-GS Audio |
|---------------|-------------|
| <audio controls> <source src="assets/audio/avnerf_kitchen_audio.wav" type="audio/wav"> Your browser does not support the audio element. </audio> | <audio controls> <source src="assets/audio/avgs_kitchen_audio.wav" type="audio/wav"> Your browser does not support the audio element. </audio> |

The kitchen scene audio captures the hum of appliances and possibly the sound of water running from a faucet.

### Example 3: Bedroom

| AV-NeRF Audio | AV-GS Audio |
|---------------|-------------|
| <audio controls> <source src="assets/audio/avnerf_bedroom_audio.wav" type="audio/wav"> Your browser does not support the audio element. </audio> | <audio controls> <source src="assets/audio/avgs_bedroom_audio.wav" type="audio/wav"> Your browser does not support the audio element. </audio> |

In the bedroom, you might hear the quiet ambiance with subtle sounds like a ceiling fan or distant traffic outside a window.
